# Portfolio Website for Aashish Kumar

Welcome to the repository for Aashish Kumar's portfolio website! This project, part of my internship at TGXSW, is now hosted on GitHub Pages and showcases HTML and CSS code designed to create a responsive site for a sketching artist and face specialist.

## Live Demo

Check out the live version of the website [here](https://dev-kant-kumar.github.io/TGXSW-WebProject/). This is the hosted version of the site on GitHub Pages.

## Project Overview

This website is designed to be a portfolio for Aashish Kumar, highlighting his artwork, services, and contact information. The layout is responsive and user-friendly, providing an engaging experience for visitors.

## HTML Structure

The website has three primary sections: Header, Main Content, and Footer.

- **Header**: Includes the navigation bar with an image, logo, menu items, and a contact button.

- **Main Content**: Contains multiple sub-sections:
  - Section 1: Welcome text and a call-to-action button.
  - Section 2: Lists services with images and descriptions.
  - Section 3: Call-to-action with image and text content.
  - Section 4: Gallery showcasing the artist's work.
  - Section 5: (Commented out) Placeholder for future content.
  - Section 6: Artist bio with image and text.
  - Section 7: Contact form with fields for name, mobile number, email, service selection, and message.

- **Footer**: Divided into two sections:
  - The first section contains the artist's name, a navigation menu, and social media icons.
  - The second section has copyright information.

## CSS Styles

The CSS file `styles.css` defines the styles for the entire website, including:

- **General Styles**: Basic styling for font, colors, and common elements.
- **Header Styles**: Styles for the navigation bar, logo, and contact button.
- **Main Content Styles**: Styles for content sections, service containers, gallery, and the contact form.
- **Footer Styles**: Styles for footer navigation, social media icons, and copyright information.

## Running Locally

To run the website locally, clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Ensure the `styles.css` file is in the same directory for proper styling.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dev-kant-kumar/TGXSW-WebProject.git
cd TGXSW-WebProject
open index.html
```
